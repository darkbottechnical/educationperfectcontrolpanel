# The EP control panel
Documentation on the control panel and stuff you can do with it as a student.

## Where to find it
The original url of https://app.educationperfect.com/controlpanel has moved and now leads to assessment results, possibly to prevent students from finding it. 
Instead, go to https://app.educationperfect.com/controlpanel/content/manage to access the content library, where you can create your own pointless content and get all the answers to existing content.

## Stuff You Can Do
### Creating Content
Start by creating a top-level folder to hold your content. Then you can select the folder, and right click the middle area of the screen to create content.
