# The EP control panel
Documentation on the control panel and stuff you can do with it as a student.

## Where to find it
The original url of https://app.educationperfect.com/controlpanel has moved and now leads to assessment results, possibly to prevent students from finding it. 
Instead, go to https://app.educationperfect.com/controlpanel/content/manage to access the content library, where you can create your own pointless content and get all the answers to existing content.

## Stuff You Can Do
### Creating Content
Start by creating a top-level folder to hold your content. Then you can select the folder, and right click the middle area of the screen to create content.

You should be able to figure out the rest, I'm too lazy to add any more steps.

### Getting Answers to Existing Modules
There should be a dropdown list in the top left corner of the screen where you can select from various libraries of content by subject. Swicthing should give you different folders of content.

From there you can go into an activity of your choice and view a question, there should be an option to see the answer.
